<p>You still have to earn money to meet your needs, so youâ€™ve decided to monetize your wish-granting abilities. But with this greedy decision came a curse upon you from the magical powers-that-be. You can only grant the wishes of one people out of three. So, you will get three wishes from three different people, but you need to decide which one to grant. </p>
